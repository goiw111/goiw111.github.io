Hi there! I\'m a tech lover whose journey started when I was a kid, tinkering with web development and cybersecurity. Those early days sparked a curiosity about how technology shapes our world—a passion that’s grown over the years and led me to develop over a decade of experience with Linux.

My academic adventure began with a Bachelor's in Physics, where I balanced theoretical insights with practical projects, like building a quadcopter drone that combined my interests in electronics and control systems. Today, I’m pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering & Embedded Systems at FPL Larache, further merging my diverse skill set.

This blog is a space where I share my experiences, projects, and ideas. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or someone looking to learn more about the exciting intersections of hardware, software, and security, I hope you find something here that inspires you.
