As a master’s student, I rely on Obsidian for organizing my research notes, ideas, and resources—its graph view and local-first approach make it perfect for long-term knowledge management. But when I want to share polished articles, I use Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator.

The problem? Manually converting Obsidian notes into Hugo-ready Markdown was tedious. I needed a way to:

- Convert ```[[wikilinks]] → [Markdown links](/posts/slug)```
- Transform ```![[image.png]] → ![](/images/image.png)```and copy images to /static/images
- Auto-generate title and date in front matter while preserving existing YAML
So, I built an Obsidian plugin to automate this process. 

Here’s how it works, step by step.

Create a GitHub repository
- Go to GitHub
- Create a new public repository named username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. In my case, this was goiw111.github.io.

Step 2: Setting Up Your Hugo Blog

1. Install Hugo
macOS/Linux:

```
brew install hugo  # macOS
sudo apt-get install hugo  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

For other operating systems, please refer to [Hugo’s installation documentation.](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

2. Create a New Hugo Site
```
hugo new site username.github.io && cd username
```

This generates:
```
my_blog/
├── archetypes/
├── content/       # Your posts go here
├── static/       # Images/assets
└── config.toml   # Site settings
```

3. Add a Theme
Example (using Stack):

```
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack themes/stack
```

This creates/modifies:

```
my_blog/
├── .gitmodules  # <-- New file with submodule config
└── themes/stack # <-- Cloned theme
```

4. Verify .gitmodules File
The file should contain:

```ini
[submodule "themes/stack"]
	path = themes/stack
	url = https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack.git
```

Configure config.toml:
```toml
theme = "stack"
baseURL = "https://yourdomain.com"
languageCode = "en-us"
paginate = 5

[params]
  title = "My Blog"
  description = "Thoughts on tech and life"
  ....
```
5. Folder Structure for Obsidian Export
Ensure these directories exist:

```
mkdir -p content/posts  # Where notes will export to
mkdir -p static/images  # Where images will copy to
```
6. Test Locally
```
hugo server -D
```
Visit http://localhost:1313 to see your site.

**step 3 : Set up GitHub Actions**
Once your changes are pushed to GitHub, you need to make some adjustments to the settings page. In your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Pages.

Under Build and Deployment, update the source from Deploy from a branch to GitHub Action, as shown in the screenshot below.

To automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub pages, you need to set up a workflow for GitHub Actions. In your local repository, create a new folder called .github/workflows and add hugo.yaml file with the following contents:

```yaml
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.145.0
      HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
      TZ: America/Los_Angeles
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
          && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb
      - name: Install Dart Sass
        run: sudo snap install dart-sass
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: "[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] && npm ci || true"
      - name: Cache Restore
        id: cache-restore
        uses: actions/cache/restore@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache
          key: hugo-${{ github.run_id }}
          restore-keys:
            hugo-
      - name: Build with Hugo
        run: |
          hugo \
	        --cleanDestinationDir \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/" \
            --cacheDir "${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache"
      - name: Cache Save
        id: cache-save
        uses: actions/cache/save@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache
          key: ${{ steps.cache-restore.outputs.cache-primary-key }}
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

**step 4 : Connect to Obsidian Export Plugin**

firs clone the plugin to you Vault plugin folder (/path/to/Obsidian Vault/.obsidian/plugins/)
from this repo [hugo_exporter](https://github.com/goiw111/hugo_exporter)

```
cd your-obsidian-vault/.obsidian/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/goiw111/hugo_exporter.git
```
- **Enable** in Obsidian:  
```
Settings → Community Plugins → Enable "Hugo Export"
```

In the plugin settings (Obsidian → Hugo Export):

```
Posts Directory: /full/path/to/my_blog/content/posts 
Images Directory: /full/path/to/my_blog/static/images 
```

Open note → Ctrl+P → "Export Active Note to Hugo"

Verify Exports
```
cd your-hugo-folder
hugo server -D  # Check at http://localhost:1313
```

8. (Optional) Deployment Setup
Create a deploy.sh script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
hugo --minify
cd public && git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push
```
now run:
```
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
Now your Hugo blog is ready!
