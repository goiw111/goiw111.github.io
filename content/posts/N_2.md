## Introduction 

This project wasn’t just about making music with hardware – it was a **hardware detective story**. Armed with an ancient Chinese FPGA board and zero documentation, I accepted the challenge to breathe life into forgotten technology. Here’s how I turned frustration into a functional synthesizer!

## Overcoming Buzzer Limitations  

One of the first problems I encountered was that the passive buzzer couldn't properly reproduce middle C (C4, 262Hz) and lower notes. When attempting to play the classic "Do Re Mi" scale starting from C4, the buzzer produced weak, distorted sounds with noticeable clicking artifacts rather than clear musical tones.  

### Why Standard Frequencies Failed  

1. **Physical Constraints of Piezo Buzzers**:  
   - Passive buzzers rely on mechanical vibration, which dampens significantly at lower frequencies  
   - The buzzer's resonant frequency was much higher than middle C, causing poor energy transfer  

2. **Square Wave Limitations**:  
   - Low-frequency square waves (below ~400Hz) created audible "clicks" between pulses  
   - The buzzer's physical response time couldn't keep up with slow oscillations  

### The High-Frequency Workaround  

By shifting the musical scale up one octave to C5–C6 (523–1047 Hz), we achieved:  

1. **Stronger Acoustic Output**:  
   - Piezo elements resonate more efficiently at these frequencies  
   - Audible volume increased by approximately 300% compared to middle C attempts  

2. **Cleaner Waveform Reproduction**:  
   - Eliminated the clicking artifacts of low-frequency operation  
   - Produced recognizable musical tones instead of distorted pulses  

3. **Technical Advantages**:  
   - Smaller counter values fit perfectly in our 13-bit registers  
   - Reduced timing errors from FPGA clock division  

This frequency shift became the foundation for all subsequent sound generation in the project, proving that sometimes the solution isn't to fight hardware limitations, but to redesign around them. The resulting tones, while higher-pitched than originally intended, maintained clear musical relationships and demonstrated the FPGA's sound generation capabilities.

## **Step 1: How Digital Music Works**

### **Square Waves = Sound**

A **square wave** is the foundation of digital sound generation. By toggling an FPGA pin between HIGH (3.3V) and LOW (0V) at precise intervals, we create a waveform that a passive buzzer converts into audible sound through mechanical vibration.

### **Frequency Formula**
$$ f_n = \tfrac { f_c } {N.2}​​ $$
- $f_c​$ : Clock speed after prescaling (5 MHz here).
- $N$ : Counter value defining the note’s period.

## **Step 2: VHDL Code Walkthrough**

### **Complete Code Structure**

```VHDL

use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

        clk     : in  STD_LOGIC;   -- 50 MHz clock

    );
end buzzer;

            if clk_div1 < 9 then
                clk_div1 <= clk_div1 + 1;
            else
                clk_div1 <= (others => '0');

                end if;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;

end Behavioral;
```

**Code Explanation :**  
The VHDL code above generates a square wave for a passive buzzer using an FPGA. A **clock prescaler** reduces the 50 MHz input to 5 MHz. A **state machine** cycles through eight musical notes (C5–C6), each defined by a fixed counter value. A **duration counter** holds each note for ~3 seconds before advancing to the next. A **frequency counter** toggles the buzzer output (`out_bit`) at the note’s frequency: when the counter reaches the note’s value (e.g., 4780 for C5), it resets and flips the output. The system resets via an active-low `rst` signal, initializing all counters and states. The design uses behavioral synthesis, with a single `process` handling clock edges and state transitions. Each note’s frequency is calculated using the formula fn​=2Nfc​​, where N is the counter value.

## **Step 3: Hardware Setup**

I discovered that there are four clock inputs on the schematic, so I assigned CLK3 (PIN_92).

![N_2_1](/images/N_2_1.png)

and the builtin buzzer is connected to the PIN_94 as output as shown there.

![N_2_2](/images/N_2_2.png)

and the fourth button (PIN_67) will be connected to the reset input.

### Conclusion: Choose Your FPGA Wisely

While this project was a valuable learning experience, I strongly advise against using obscure, outdated FPGAs like the Cyclone EP1C3T144C8. The challenges I faced highlight several key issues:

1. **Outdated Tools** : Quartus II 13.0 is outdated, lacking modern features and support. Modern alternatives like Quartus Prime Lite offer free, updated software with improved debugging tools and simulation capabilities.
    
2. **Limited Documentation** : Chinese-only documentation can be a significant barrier. Modern FPGA boards come with comprehensive English datasheets and active community support, making troubleshooting and learning much easier.
    
3. **Incomplete Schematics** : The lack of schematics and pinout information made hardware setup difficult. Contemporary FPGA development boards provide detailed documentation, ensuring a smoother integration process.
    

Legacy hardware certainly teaches resilience and problem-solving skills, but modern FPGAs offer significant advantages in terms of ease of use, support, and long-term sustainability. Investing in a well-documented, widely supported FPGA platform will save time, reduce frustration, and enhance your overall project experience. Choose wisely to ensure a successful and enjoyable development journey!
